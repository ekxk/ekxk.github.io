        ## Route
        Daejeon - Jecheon - Danyang - Darian - HIKING - Darian - Danyang - Daejeon

        대전 - 제천 - 단양 - 다리안 - **등산** - 다리안 - 단양 - 대전
        
        ## How did we get there and back home
        - From Daejeon to Jecheon, take the train at night. Spend the night in Jecheon to get the morning train to Danyang
        - Depart to Danyang using the train at 7.06 am.
        - From Danyang, we planned to take the taxi to 다리안관광지. However, as we go out, there is a bus going in that route, so we took the bus.
        - after the hike, we took the taxi to Danyang and board the train directly to Daejeon.

        ### How much does it cost:
        - for the train: 10,100 + 8,400 + 11,600
        - for the taxi: 14,800
        - for the bus: maybe the same as normal bus fee

        ## Hiking course
        We take the same route up and down.

        It was very steep but we didn't realize it at first because of the very foggy.

        We can barely see the wide field of Sobaek as we were reaching the peak.

        The wind was strong and left my clothes freezing as we left the peak and headed back down.

        On our way down, the sky was getting clearer and we could see the steep terrain well, which made us think: "No wonder we were out of breath"

        We arrived back in 다리안관광지 with enough spare time for praying and eating.

        We ordered 고기뺀 김치찌개 ~
