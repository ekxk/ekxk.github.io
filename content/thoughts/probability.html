        # Probability

        I adore people that can teach, inspire that spark within other(s) to be curious and interested in life. 

        Now, a very interesting way of thinking has just been built after hearing Chris Piech in his first video lecture on CS109 2022. He said this is some nice little philosophy:
    </md-block>
    <blockquote>    
        "We live in a world where there might be finite things, but there's infinite combinations of those things. <br>It's not infinite but The Step of Rule of Counting leads to so many unique combinations so fast that our world of combination is incredibly large."
    </blockquote>
    <md-block>
        He also said a couple of things that helps me build a new construct of thinking:
    </md-block>
    <blockquote> 
        Probability is not solved.<br>Think about something you love that maybe not everybody loves.<br>There's a good chance there is a meaty interesting problem in the intersection of probability, computer science, and that thing you love.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote> 
        Brain = Beautiful probability machines
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote> 
        > You get more information, you could understand how to incorporate that more information to improve you probabilistic understanding. <br>And it just makes us better understand the world around us. <br>And if you understand the world around us, you can start to build things for that world.
    </blockquote>
    <md-block>
        What an unexpected and interesting take from a Probability for Computer Science class, right?

        This suddenly makes me want to have a great understanding of probability and somehow share it as well. I'm not sure yet which form it will take.

        In a world of very large combinations of things, I can choose so many things to do. But that is also my problem. How can I choose with my limited knowledge? Maybe I need to expand my knowledge.

        I hope I can choose well, be diligent, committed, and content. Maybe I should know when to give up too. I will pray to know the lines.
