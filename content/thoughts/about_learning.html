        # About learning

        I think one of the earliest thing I learned during my graduate school journey is that 

        if God is willing,

        *we can learn anything, everything; but we can't be the expert on everything.*

        With all this knowledge in this world, we will not have time to ingest all of it.

        Let alone becoming an expert; it's impossible to be informed or knowledgeable about all aspects in this world.

    <blockquote>
        If all the trees on earth were pens and the ocean ˹were ink˺, refilled by seven other oceans, the Words of Allah would not be exhausted. Surely Allah is Almighty, All-Wise. (Quran 31:27)
    </blockquote>    
    <md-block>
        
        Therefore, I think I need to choose. Choose what to learn each and every day. Choose which thing(s) I am going to use my capabilities for.

        **This has helped me** to ease myself when I see the huge amount of reading I have yet to read. 
        
        It has helped me accept that so many people are experts, when I know nothing, yet all of them combined are nothing compared to all the true knowledge that exists.

        **It gives me relief** to know that I am here not for knowing everything and being an expert in everything. What am I to take the position of such power and knowledge?

        It gives me relief to know that I belong to the one who knows everything, even beyond what our mind can conceive of as 'everything'.

        Indeed, ˹it is˺ We ˹Who˺ created humankind and ˹fully˺ know what their souls whisper to them, and We are closer to them than ˹their˺ jugular vein. (Quran 50:16)
