        # About learning

        I think one of the earliest thing I learned during my graduate school journey is that 

        if God is willing,

        *we can learn anything, everything; but we can't be the expert on everything.*

        with all these many knowledge in this world, we won't have time to consume all of them.

        not to mention being an expert, being informed or knowing all the things in this world is impossible.

    <blockquote>
        If all the trees on earth were pens and the ocean ˹were ink˺, refilled by seven other oceans, the Words of Allah would not be exhausted. Surely Allah is Almighty, All-Wise. (Quran 31:27)
    </blockquote>    
    <md-block>
        Therefore, I think I need to choose. Choose what to learn each and every day. Choose which thing(s) I am going to use my capabilities for.

        **This has helped me** to ease myself when I see the huge amount of reading I have yet to read. 
        
        It has helped me accept that so many people are experts, when I know nothing,
        
        yet all of them combined are nothing compared to all the true knowledge that exists.

        **It gives me relief** to know that I am here not for knowing everything and being an expert in everything. What am I to take the position of such power and knowledge?

        It gives me relief since I belong to the one who knows everything, even beyond what our mind can conceive of as 'everything'.
